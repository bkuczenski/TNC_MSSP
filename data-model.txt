A listing of data types used to serialize the Monitoring, Assessment, and
Harvest Control Rules spreadsheets.

Attributes -- an enumeration of unique text strings- the vocabulary
describing the entities.

Targets -- easy-to-create enumeration of target entities, their type
(Monitoring, Assessment, ControlRule) and a list of attributes- since
attributes are just text strings anyway.


Questions -- de-duplicated enumeration of questions with ordered lists of
valid answers. The order will be initially populated arbitrarily (by
order encountered) and will be corrected by hand.

Generating the de-duplicated question list requires using the spreadsheets
plus a list of synonym and satisfies statements (themselves indexed with
literal spreadsheet references). This in turn will require the "satisfies"
predicates to be created and their ancestral references removed.

Notations -- an enumeration of unique SCORED notation strings that appear
in the table data.  The scores are determined from background color
according to a predefined rubric.

Criteria -- a table of foreign keys: Question-ID, Target-ID, threshold,
where threshold is one of the valid_answers to the referenced question.

Caveats -- a table of grid data: Question-ID, question-sense, Target-ID,
note-ID (or more usefully for the serialization note-text, note-score)

And that's it.


External resources required:
 - mapping of 'synonym' and 'satisfies' questions
 - mapping of RGB color specs to scores
