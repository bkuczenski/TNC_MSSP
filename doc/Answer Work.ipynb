Hierarchical Decision Trees allow for a decision to be reached by a sequential series of intermediate decisions. The most important decision criteria are in the upper part of the tree and applied first. Hierarchical Decision Trees provide a useful framework for harvest strategies when different decision rules are appropriate in different circumstances (Basson and Dowling, 2008; Davies et al. 2007; Prince et al. 2011; Venables and Ripley 2002; Wilson et al. 2010;).
