Notes for SNAP project staff:

 1. Every spreadsheet needs a specially designated row/column designating
    "Valid Answers" for each question. Answers must be semicolon-delimited
    (i.e. "low; low-medium; medium..."). The "Valid Answers" cell may be
    left blank to use the default set, which is "no; yes".

 2. Spreadsheets should be FROZEN.
