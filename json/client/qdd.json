The indicators are derived from the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fishing and cover ecological, technological, economic and social dimensions, and are scored by expert judgement or quantitative information. The process of application clarifies which indicators perform poorly and so which aspects of management need to be improved. To track fishery performance through time the indicators should remain fixed so that analyses are comparable (Murillas et al., 2008; Pitcher et al., 2008; Pitcher et al., 2013).

Indirect notion of stock status across multiple indicators and/or \"quasi\" assessments. Indicators need to be independent. Hierachical decision trees. Decision trees can be on any indicator combinations of two or more, but these need to be independent. Hierarchical decision trees are about unique stock-status based interpretations based on the indicator combinations - e.g. low fishery-dep density estimate and high catch = suggested depletion; high density with high catch might be okay, low catch low density = possibly overfished; high density low catch = possibly underexploited. Hierarchical Decision Trees allow for a decision to be reached by a sequential series of intermediate decisions. The most important decision criteria are in the upper part of the tree and applied first. Hierarchical Decision Trees provide a useful framework for harvest strategies when different decision rules are appropriate in different circumstances (Basson and Dowling, 2008; Davies et al. 2007; Prince et al. 2011; Venables and Ripley 2002; Wilson et al. 2010;).

Make sure this doesn't rule out options.. Are we talking about relative GVP of that species - e.g. high value but low abundance like chita. But question is \"can you afford to invest in a monitoring program for this species?\" One of the outputs of the cost database can be directly linked to this question. Jeremy tries to bin costs into 5 categories developing on % cost of GVP. BUT it's how you define value (not just in dollar terms), PLUS for chita, for e.g., it's not that much more expensive to add one more species to the port-based sampling. Here we are harking to hard dollar afforability.. ·       GDP of species:  For individual species, does this refer to the total fishery value relative to the national GDP, or does it represent the value of the species itself.
